This is the public repository for the extended simple minGDX game created in the [minGDX documentation](https://isoteriktechnologies.gitbook.io/mingdx/getting-started/extending-the-simple-game).

You can clone the repo and import into an IDE. IntelliJ IDEA 2020.1.2 was used to create this project, so it's a good idea to either use that same IDE.
or Android Studio IDE.
